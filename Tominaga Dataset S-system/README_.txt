This archive provides data files used for evaluating seven evolutionary algorithms.

***************************************
 Files containing parameters for the models used to generate the data (both S-System and ANN) contain the word 'params' in the file name. E.g. ANN10Params.txt contains parameters for an ANN model for a 10-gene network, while SS20Params.txt contains S-System parameters for a 20 gene network.
 The format of these files:
 line 1: number of genes (n)
 line 2: parameters for first gene (n incoming connection weights for ANN; n kinetic orders for synthesis - gij, n kinetic orders for degradation - hij, rate constants - alpha and beta for S-System)
 line 3: parameters for second gene 
 ...
 line n+1: parameters for n-th gene 
 
***************************************
 Files containing simulated time series for synthetic models contain the words 'generatedData' in the file name.
E.g. ANN10GeneratedData.txt contains time series generated by the ANN model for a 10-gene network, while SS20GeneratedData.txt contains time series generated by the S-System model for a 20 gene network. For the noise added data, the file names are added a suffix: e.g. SS5GeneratedData1Noise.txt contains simulated data for a 5 gene S-System with 1% added noise.

 The format of these files:
 line 1: number of genes(n) and of time series (T)
 line 2: number of time points for first time series (T1)
 line 3: T1 numbers indicating time spans between consecutive time points (first is 0)
 line 4: n numbers indicating gene expression levels for the first time point in first time series
 line 5: n numbers indicating gene expression levels for the second time point in first time series
 ...
 line T1+3: n numbers indicating gene expression levels for the T1-th time point in first time series
 repeat lines 2 to T1+3 for all time series
 
 *************************************
 Three files containing real gene expression data from yeast are also included: S7Scaled.txt (7 genes), S6Scaled.txt (6 genes) and S24Scaled.txt (24 genes) These data have been retrieved from http://genome-www.stanford.edu/cellcycle/data/rawdata/ and scaled to values between 0 and 1.
 
 *************************************
 The files for 2 and 5 gene S-System models have the name Tominaga as a prefix, as these models have been introduced in  "Tominaga D, Okamoto M, Maki Y, Watanabe S, Eguchi Y: Nonlinear Numerical Optimization Technique Based on a Genetic Algorithm for Inverse Problems: Towards the Inference of Genetic Networks" and "Kikuchi S, Tominaga D, Arita M, Takahashi K, Tomita M: Dynamic modeling of genetic networks using genetic algorithm and S-system", respectively.
